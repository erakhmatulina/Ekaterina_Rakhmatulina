		<h2>Wildfires Have Different Impacts on Two Watersheds</h2>
			<div class="content">
			<p> Findings: Over 47 years of wildfire management has little impacts on vegetation 
			    and soil moisture of one basin but has great impacts on another basin. </p>
			    <p> We used satellite imagery to quantify vegetation transitions during the 47 years of managed wildfire in SCB (1971-2018) and compared these transitions to the changes observed in ICB \citep{Boisram2018}.
			     Both spatially distributed and in situ soil moisture data were collected in SCB and ICB and categorized by different vegetation types (mixed conifer, dense meadow, sparse meadow, and shrub). 
			     Dense meadows had the highest soil moisture values, but there was little difference between all other cover types in SCB.
			       Fire-driven changes in dominant vegetation type (observed from aerial imagery analysis) and forest structure (observed from forestry plot data) were minimal at SCB, especially when compared to ICB.
			        This can be partially explained by SCB's lower productivity associated with lower precipitation totals (56-88% of ICB's precipitation). 
			        We infer that the managed fire regime in SCB has not led to large changes in soil moisture regimes in the basin.

			<h2> Findings: Hydrological benefits of historically observed wildfire management on a medium sized watershed are expected to have similar effects in future climate. </h2>
			    <p> The hydrological effects of restoring wildfire in Sierra Nevada forests are of great interest to managers, given the importance of these forests to California's water supply. 
			     Data analysis and past modeling studies of the Illilouette Creek Basin (ICB) found that managed wildfire increased streamflow yields from the basin by approximately 5% compared to during fire suppression, and did so during a period  when streamflow in other regional basins was declining \citep{Boisrame2017,boisrame2019}.
			      However, the changes in the ICB fire management policy were initiated nearly 50 years ago.  Fire management changes implemented now and over the coming years in Sierra Nevada basins will occur under a different climate than what was experienced during the 20th Century. 
			       My objective was to determine whether the positive co-benefits for water supply from wildfire restoration in the ICB (as a case study) would be preserved under future climates.
			        We infer that the managed fire regime in SCB has not led to large changes in soil moisture regimes in the basin.

Blue, orange, and red vertical lines denote historical, 30\%, and 60\% increase in frequency of fire events, respectively.</p>

		  		<p> Figure \ref{fig:RHESSysResults} (right hand panel) presents summary results showing how basin-scale streamflow and soil moisture storage change following the restoration of a fire regime under historical, rcp 4.5, and rcp 8.5 climate scenarios.  The results indicate that despite minor differences in the timeseries, broadly there is no difference in the impact of fire on ICB hydrology under future versus historical climates: in both cases, restoring fire regimes in the basin leads to an increase of 15 mm/year specific discharge and 
a maximum increase of 32-33 mm soil water storage.  </p>

		<h2>Findings: post-fire soil water repellency decreases with freeze/thaw cycles on wet but not dry soil </h2>
				<a class="close" href="#!">&times;</a>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Wildfires are a cause of soil water repellency (hydrophobicity), which reduces infiltration while increasing erosion and flooding from post-fire rainfall. 
			Post-fire soil water repellency degrades over time, often in response to repeated wetting and drying of the soil.
			 In mountainous fire prone forests such as those in the Western USA, however, the fire season often terminates in a cold and wet winter, during which soils not only wet and dry, but also freeze and thaw.
			   Little is know about the effect of repeated freezing and thawing of soil on the breakdown of post-fire hydrophobicity. This study characterized the changes in hydrophobicity of Sierra Nevada mountain soils exposed to different combinations of wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycling. Following each cycle, hydrophobicity was measured using the Molarity of Ethanol test.
			     Hydrophobicity declined similarly across all experiments that included a wetting cycle.
			       Repeated freezing and thawing of dry soil did not degrade soil water repellency.
			       Total soil organic matter content was not different between soils of contrasting hydrophobicity.
			       Macroscopic changes such as fissures and cracks were observed to form as soil hydrophobicity decayed.
			       Microscopic changes revealed by scanning electron microscope imagery suggest different levels of soil aggregation occurred in samples with distinct hydrophobicities, although the size of aggregates was not clearly correlated to the change in water repellency due to wet-dry and freeze-thaw cycling.
			       A nine year climate and soil moisture record at Providence Critical Zone Observatory was used to relate the persistence of hydrophobicity in the laboratory to its expected longevity of 144 days at this well-characterized, typical mid-elevation Sierra Nevada site.
			       Large portion of the breakdown in soil water repellency (79%) at this site is attributable to freeze-thaw cycling, underscoring the importance of this process in soil recovery from fire. </p>

		<h2>Findings: Soil moisture best explains fuel moisture for 10-hr fuels</h2>
		<a class="close" href="#!">&times;</a>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Fuel moisture is a crucial determinant of fire behavior and risk. Fuel moisture is usually described in terms of live fuels (living plants) and dead fuels.  Although fuel moisture is often observed to provide input into fire risk assessments, it is usually not possible to measure it everywhere, forcing fire managers to rely on proxy fuel moisture indices. Mostly, these indices draw on atmospheric conditions. However, dead fuels are typically in hydraulic contact with soils, and a (minimal) body of previous work suggested that soil moisture influenced fuel moisture, potentially creating another mechanistic link between fire and water cycles.  In this project, I aim to better understand whether a relationship exists between soil moisture and dead fuel moisture across multiple locations and moisture gradients.  </p>
